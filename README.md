# CLIHINT: Terminal Cheat Engine v1.0

**Powered by: STREAKY x Voidbro**

> A digital blade forged in the Void. This is not just a tool. It’s an arsenal.

---

## What is CLIHINT?
CLIHINT is a terminal-based cheat engine crafted for hackers, devs, and learners who thrive in the terminal. No fluff. Just pure, categorized cheat codes for speed, power, and flow.

**Why?** Because flipping through 200-page PDFs or searching Google mid-shell is *void-tier distraction*. CLIHINT injects the command you need in the moment you need it.

---

## Features
- **200+ Developer Cheats** *(Python-focused, more coming)*
- **Cybersec Packs:** Red Team, Payloads, OSINT, Web Recon, and more.
- **Cheat Mode Navigation:** Pick a category, view 10 curated commands per pack.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Each command includes a description + real-world example.
- **Organized Codebase:** Modular screen/cheats/utils layout for scaling.
